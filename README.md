dta# Encription
Converts Messages into encrypted code and also decipher the codes.
Pocess behind the working of the Encryption
1. Creating random shift values and creating an Encrypted text
2. This shfit value along with size of the array is stored in a String key which is has combination characters and variables
3. This inner character values comination forms (inner)keys which stores variable(key) and value pairs which are randomised in the key and along with a lot trash key value pairs
4. This key is combined with the binary input of the string and sent as input for deciphering.
5. Hence be creating special (inner) key value pairs inside the main keycode allows that only the person with the right deciphering algorithm to crack the will be able to acess it.
6.Due to this random generations of loactions makes it a Encrypted code different and also the key different for the same string
7.This idea can be expanded to the whole ascii sepctra and and by another creating more (inner)key value pairs and integrating it with the binary code will make this code harder to decipher
